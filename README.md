EDA for Car Price Prediction Model
________________________________________

Descriptions :

•	A .json file containing a dataset consisting of 15919 rows and 54 columns is provided.
•	This dataset, scraped from the on-line car trading company in 2019, contains many features of 9 different car models.
•	The features (variables) of this dataset are too messy and distored.

What I have done;

•	I read the .json file and assigned the dataset into a DataFrame using pandas,

•	I implemented all aspects of the EDA process to the dataset,

•	I fixed corrupted data formats,

•	I handled with outliers and missing values, I used internet to do research regarding automobiles.

•	I dropped the columns / rows determined unnecessary as a result of my analysis,

•	I used visualization tools while doing all EDA processes.

•	As a result, I got the dataset ready to provide an appropriate input to the ML models.

•	I saved cleaned dataset into a .csv file.

Introduction

Welcome to "AutoScout Data Analysis Project". This is the capstone project of Data Analysis Module. Auto Scout data which using for this project, scraped from the on-line car trading company in 2019, contains many features of 9 different car models. In this project, you will have the opportunity to apply many commonly used algorithms for Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis by using many Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy you will analyze clean dataset.

The project consists of 3 parts:

•	First part is related with 'data cleaning'. It deals with Incorrect Headers, Incorrect Format, Anomalies, Dropping useless columns.

•	Second part is related with 'filling data'. It deals with Missing Values. Categorical to numeric transformation is done.

•	Third part is related with 'handling outliers of data' via Visualisation libraries. Some insights are extracted.
